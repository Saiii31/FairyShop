					<h1>HIGH PROTEIN</h1>
					<p>Our yoghurt provides an impressive amount of protein, with around 10.5 grams per 100g. Protein has been shown to support metabolism by increasing your energy expenditure, or the number of calories that you burn throughout the day.
                    Getting enough protein is also important for appetite regulation, as it increases the production of hormones that signal fullness.
                    Indian yoghurt has been shown to influence appetite control and delay feelings of hunger more than regular yoghurt with less protein.

                    <h1>NUTRIENT RICH</h1>
					<p>Our yoghurt contains some of nearly every nutrient that your body needs. Itâ€™s contains calcium, necessary for healthy teeth and bones. Just one cup provides 49% of your daily calcium needs. 
                    It is also high in B vitamins, particularly vitamin B12 and riboflavin, both of which may protect against heart disease and certain neural tube birth defects. </p>

                    <h1>THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</h1>
                    <p>Consuming yoghurt on a regular basis may strengthen your immune system and reduce your likelihood of contracting an illness. Probiotics have been shown to reduce inflammation, which is linked to several health conditions ranging from viral infections to gut disorders. 
                    Moreover, the immune-enhancing properties of yoghurt are partly due to its magnesium, selenium and zinc, which are trace minerals known for the role they play in immune system health.</p>
